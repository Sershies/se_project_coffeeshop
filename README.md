## Plan on improving the project

1. Enhance the Recipes page by incorporating dynamic transitions for a more engaging and vibrant experience.
2. Refine the form pages to improve the overall user experience and ensure smooth functionality.
3. Optimize the layout of the book table page by reducing its size, making it more user-friendly and accessible.
